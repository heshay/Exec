Intro about his company
- allow personal trainers, to do admin stufff on a mobile app (payments & stuff, booking, etc.)
- going into open beta, converting that into design and dev tickets (100+ users)
- Any current users? Closed beta with 3/4 people.
- Get's direct feedback thru user testing in closed, beta, typeform, easy to connect to spreadsheet in google drive
- looks good and you can brand it. 

In his career, going back?
-  AxiomZen in vancouver, lauched cryptokitties game. (try to understand why it was successful)
- Also launching NBA topshop
- Receive the incentive they have to get the feedback over the next 3 weeks. 
- go into spreadsheet from typeform
- they had bugs & UX issues, bad designing what obvious to do next, buttons weren't clear (accumulative). More people, the more serious we knew it was. 
- Blockchain onboarding bc they need cryptowallet. (feedback) like how blockchain works. 
- a lot of sprint planning, how long it was going to take to triage element. 
- 12 hours of work to triage the feedback for multiple people (for UX team). Not wasting everyone's time as well. 
- meetings are expensive with developers and stuff so sprint planning
- sometimes not everyone is clear with the feedback, which is why he likes interview process. 
- 

What I'd ask:
- How do you transform the feedback from spreadsheet to tasks?
- How do you plan to manage the feedback when you open the open beta?
- How much time did you spend managing this feedback? (asked)
- What is the volume of feedback?
- Was it just the number of feedback that was important?
