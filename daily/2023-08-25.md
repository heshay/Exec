# Meeting w/ Marlond
- hard to setup sync
- unclear documentation preventing people from finding what they need to do to setup the sync.
- bad communication on the landing page

Maybe:
- quick capture experience?
- reliability of sync?

how can we capture the analytics (questions):
- how many people are trying the app, try to setup sync and are unable to do so. What's the funnel for this this? (Hit landing page, sign up, setup obsidian plugin, etc.)
- Why are they using other capture apps and not FN?

We need to do:
- simplify the setup for sync (as easy as possible)
- figure out analytics to see how we are doing (not flying blind)
- have more conversations with customers to figure out why Fleeting Notes is not the best quick capture solution for Obsidian. Why use like Drafts or email or whatever over this? 
- drag and drop

marlond tasks:
- [x] go thru mom test
- [x] setup call with 3 customers (from reddit, discord, or just reaching out and emailing, customers using other products)

Matt's task:
- [x] setup calls with 3 customers.
