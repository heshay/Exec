Are you tired of spending too much time taking notes and organizing them into your knowledge management system? Well, I've got a solution for you! In this blog post, I'm going to walk you through how to take screenshots from your browser, annotate them, and have them automatically sync into Obsidian.

First things first, you need to install the [Fleeting Notes browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fleeting-notes/gcplhmogdjioeaenmehmapbdonklmdnc). Once you've got that installed, let's get started.

**Step 1:** Take a screenshot. On a Mac, you can do this by pressing Command + Control + Shift + 4. On Windows, it's Windows + Shift + S.

**Step 2:** Click the Fleeting Notes button to create a new note. Give your note a title, like "New Note Title," and then paste in the screenshot you just took.

**Step 3:** Add any annotations you want at the bottom of the note. This is a great way to add context to your screenshot and make it more useful in the future.

And that's it! You'll now  that your note has been created in Obsidian, complete with the screenshot and annotations. No need to spend time manually importing the screenshot and typing out notes.

I hope this blog post has been helpful for you. Using Fleeting Notes has really improved my note-taking and productivity, and I hope it does the same for you.
