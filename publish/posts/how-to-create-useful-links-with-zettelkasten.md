The linking feature of [[publish/notes/Zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]] is one of its [[notes/connecting ideas is powerful|most defining features]], yet, it's the least understood. Linking ideas should be [[notes/linking ideas should be natural|natural]] for us, but a lifetime of organization with the [[notes/organization with the tree structure|tree structure]] has made it difficult to adopt this new form of organization. To make links useful, we'll [[notes/old habits make it hard to learn new things|need to unlearn our old habits]]. This is an entire paradigm shift, so don't expect it to be easy. 

## Don't group things, connect them
The biggest mistake—and one I've made myself—is linking with categories. In other words, it's adding links like we would with tags. When we link this way we're more focused on [[notes/To create useful links, we need to connect, not group|grouping rather than connecting]]. As a result, we have notes that contain many connections with little to no relevance. Additionally, we add [[notes/clutter slows us down|clutter]] to our links which makes it difficult to find useful links when adding links. That being said, there are times when we might want to group some things. In these cases, use tags or folders.

**Bad Links:** `[[work]]`, `[[notes]]`, `[[school]]`, `[[food]]`

**Great Links:**  `[[notes are written to free space in the brain]]` `[[working to live or living to work depends on how meaningful someone finds their jobs]]`

## Creating points of connection
We shouldn't use links to group things together, but how do we create connections? Find the single idea behind what you're writing and create an [[notes/atomic things are self-contained|atomic]] link. These are powerful because they are [[notes/interoperable components are efficient|interoperable]]. If you're unsure how to do this, you'll see examples of links scattered throughout this blog post. Feel free to click around and "[[notes/following a train of thought|follow the train of thought]]".
