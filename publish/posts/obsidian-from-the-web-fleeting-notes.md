Just the other day, after having another insightful conversation with a user of [Fleeting Notes](https://www.fleetingnotes.app/), I was struck by a revelation. A lot of you might be familiar with the multiple use cases for Fleeting Notes, but what I've come to appreciate is how instrumental the web access for Fleeting Notes can be.

Let me paint a picture for you.

Imagine being at work, restricted to using only the official tools and websites. But an idea hits you or you come across some information you want to quickly add to your personal notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Now, with most note-taking apps, this might pose a challenge. But here's where Fleeting Notes shines – its web accessibility.

Since Fleeting Notes is [available on the web](https://my.fleetingnotes.app/) and [[sync-fleeting-notes-with-obsidian|syncs seamlessly with Obsidian]], it becomes your secret weapon! Need to make a note while at work? Just pop over to the Fleeting Notes web portal, jot down your thoughts, and voilà! Without any fuss, your notes will be waiting for you in Obsidian when you're ready for them.

I was always aware that this could be a potential use case, but it never dawned on me how significant this feature was until that conversation. So, of course, I couldn't keep it to myself. I had to share this with all of you.
