## Intro Blurb
I've talked a lot about how [[posts/zettelkasten-shouldnt-be-complicated-but-it-is|Zettelkasten is complicated]] but I've never dove deeper into exactly how I use Zettelkasten to take notes. In order to [[notes/lead by example|lead by example]], every week, I will read an article and [[posts/simplest-way-to-use-zettelkasten-for-note-management|take connected notes]]. Hopefully, this process can give you ideas about how to improve your Zettelkasten workflow. Also, feel free to suggest articles you want me to read next week.

## My Notes
**Article Link:** https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/

- I collect things mainly because of [[notes/loss aversion|loss aversion]] I don't want to potentially lose some knowledge I find meaningful
- merging content, information, ideas, and thoughts and processing it is what integrates knowledge into our brain [[notes/connecting ideas is powerful|connecting ideas is powerful]]
- bookmarking is great for navigation when you want to revisit something but is NOT good for learning [[notes/photocopying items doesnt help with learning|photocopying items doesn't help with learning]]
- I don't really get the reward like these doves. For me it's just an unnecessary step.
- I don't think reading is pointless without note taking. It still helps us but the portion of information we absorb is a lot less.
- first step to conquering [[notes/collectors fallacy|collectors fallacy]] is to realize that collecting notes does not increase knowledge
- [[notes/brain is better with small cycles of info|brain is better with small cycles of info]]

## A Video
Here is a video of me taking the notes + my commentary.
