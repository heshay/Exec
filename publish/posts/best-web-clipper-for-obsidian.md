title: The Best Web Clipper for Obsidian

description: "Let's be real, most web clippers suck. They either give limited functionality for an application or don't provide enough functionality to be anything more than a web clipper. For me, I wanted a quick way to take connected notes from the web and sync it with Obsidian. However, I couldn't find *anything* that could do that for me. So I created something that did just that."

Let's be real, most web clippers suck. They either give limited functionality for an application or don't provide enough functionality to be anything more than a web clipper. For me, I wanted a [[posts/writing-quick-notes-in-obsidian|quick way to take connected notes]] from the web and sync it with Obsidian. However, I couldn't find *anything* that could do that for me. So I created something that did just that. A fully-fledged note-taking app that makes with bi-directional linking that fits nicely into the browser and [[posts/sync-fleeting-notes-with-obsidian|syncs with Obsidian]]. Best of all, it's completely **FREE**.

If you're interested in seeing an example of how I use this, see this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7UlvWJ17U4&lc=Ugw1NVIowOGwwaI7lYN4AaABAg) of me taking notes with Fleeting Notes. Also, I want to emphasize that this is not the final product. I'd love to take suggestions on what other things you'd like. So I encourage you to join the [discord channel](https://discord.gg/xrj6yuGNmx) and follow me on my journey!
