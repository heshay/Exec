Connected notes are [[notes/connecting ideas is powerful|powerful]]. They allow you to expand upon different ideas within its own context and make it easy [[notes/reusing components is more efficient|reuse]] notes.

There exists Obsidian publish but this service is gated by a paywall and is geared towards content creators. Sometimes [we want to share a note](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/vf8vx6/do_you_want_to_share_your_connected_notes/) (+ all the links within the note) without the hassle of setting up a website or paying a monthly fee. Some example use cases include:
-   explaining a concept to a friend
-   sharing notes for a particular class
-   showcasing the coolness of your connected notes!

So in Fleeting Notes I added a sharing feature that makes it possible to share connected notes. The awesome part of this—and how it relates to Obsidian—is that Fleeting Notes can [[posts/sync-fleeting-notes-with-obsidian|sync with Obsidian]] through a plugin. With this you can have shared notes (in Fleeting Notes) that are also synced with your Obsidian vault.
