Today, I want to talk to you about how to use global shortcut keys to quickly take notes into Obsidian through the [Fleeting Notes](https://www.fleetingnotes.app/) app, as well as how to set it up for yourself. As someone who takes a lot of notes, I know how time-consuming it can be to switch back and forth between apps or programs to jot down my thoughts.

First, you need to install the [Fleeting Notes app extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fleeting-notes/gcplhmogdjioeaenmehmapbdonklmdnc). Once you have it installed, you can easily set up your own shortcut keys.

Here's how you can do that:

1.  Click on the "Extensions" button in your Obsidian window
2.  Click on "Manage Extensions"
3.  Click on the hamburger menu on the side
4.  Click on "Keyboard Shortcuts"
5.  Scroll down until you see the Fleeting Notes extension settings
6.  Look for the "Create New Note" and "Open Persistent Window" shortcut bindings

Once you've found those, you can set up your own custom shortcut key. It can be anything you want, depending on your personal preferences. For example, you could use Command Shift N or Command Shift K.

Now that you've set up your shortcut key, let's see it in action!

1.  Open up your Obsidian window
2.  Press your custom shortcut key (e.g. Command Shift N)
3.  A new window will pop up with the Fleeting Notes app
4.  Type in your note (e.g. "Hello world")
5.  Once you hit save, your note will automatically populate in Obsidian

It's that easy! You can also use the "Open Persistent Window" shortcut binding to open the search screen directly, without creating a new note.

I hope this tutorial was helpful for you. By using Fleeting Notes, you'll be able to take notes quickly and efficiently, without any unnecessary distractions or interruptions. Happy note-taking!
