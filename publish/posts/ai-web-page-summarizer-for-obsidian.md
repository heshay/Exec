Have you ever stumbled upon an article while browsing the web and thought, "Man, I wish I could get a summary of this article right into Obsidian!" Well, now you can! With the amazing Fleeting Notes plugin, summarizing web articles and seamlessly integrating them into your notes has never been easier.

Here's how it works: simply open the [Fleeting Notes](https://www.fleetingnotes.app/) browser extension, [setup the plugin](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-plugins/blob/main/plugins/official/summarize-source/README.md),  then run the plugin command `summarize-source` (adjustable alias). This command fetches the content of the article, condenses it into bite-sized bullet points, and automatically populates your note with the summarized bullet points.

But that's not all! Once you've saved your notes, you can effortlessly [[sync-fleeting-notes-with-obsidian|sync them with Obsidian]] by following the simple setup instructions. Seamlessly transferring your notes from the web has never been this convenient!

Now, I must be honest with you, my friend. While I'm super excited to share this plugin with you, I haven't set up any restrictions just yet. Please don't go overboard and use it excessively. Why, you ask? Well, the [ChatGPT API](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis), which powers Fleeting Notes, comes with some costs, and I want to ensure it remains accessible for everyone (i.e. don't hit my spending cap). In the future, I plan to add restrictions to allow this plugin to better serve everyone. 

If you're not satisfied with the prompt used to create the summaries, fret not! Fleeting Notes allows you to adjust the prompt according to your preferences. You can fine-tune it using the [metadata within the plugin command settings](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-plugins/blob/main/plugins/official/summarize-source/README.md#configuration), enabling you to tailor the summaries to your liking. Talk about customization at your fingertips!

So, what are you waiting for? Give Fleeting Notes a whirl and experience the magic of summarizing web articles into your Obsidian notes. It's a tool that saves you time, boosts your productivity, and keeps your notes concise and organized.
