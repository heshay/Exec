As someone who uses Obsidian, I understand how [[put-quick-notes-into-obsidian-from-anywhere|difficult]] it can be to take quick notes on the go without losing your focus on the task at hand. That's why I created Fleeting Notes, a scratchpad that automatically [[sync-fleeting-notes-with-obsidian|syncs with your Obsidian vault]].

Recently, I added a new feature that has proven to be incredibly useful: the ability to sync your Obsidian links with Fleeting Notes. This means that any link suggestions within Fleeting Notes will match the links in your vault, making it easier to connect your fleeting ideas to your existing knowledge. And setting it up is easy - here's [[how-to-sync-obsidian-links-into-fleeting-notes|how to do it]]:
