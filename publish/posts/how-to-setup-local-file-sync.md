But before we dive into the instructions, let's quickly go over some of the benefits of using local sync:

![[Setup local file sync]]

## Recommended Workflow
If you're using Obsidian MD, I'd recommend using the [[sync-fleeting-notes-with-obsidian|Fleeting Notes Sync plugin]] to keep your notes synced between the devices.

But, if you're not using Obsidian MD or you're having trouble with the plugin, I'd recommend using the [desktop applications](https://www.fleetingnotes.app/download) (Windows / Mac) with local file sync enabled. Here is what an example workflow would look like:

1. Take Fleeting Note on your phone or within the browser extension
2. Notes will be synced to the desktop app through the cloud
3. Desktop app will sync these notes to the local file system
4. Notes will appear in text editor apps (e.g. Obsidian, Logseq)

## Limitations
Please note that there are a few limitations to consider when using local sync:

- It is not available on the web due to limitations in web APIs.
- On iOS, you cannot sync directories outside the [[ios-sandbox|sandboxed folder]]. If you're an iOS user and want to [[sync-fleeting-notes-with-obsidian|sync your notes with Obsidian MD]], you can use the Fleeting Notes plugin to do so.

Overall, setting up local sync in Fleeting Notes is quick and easy. It provides an alternative way to back up your notes and allows you to use the app with other local file managers. Just keep in mind the limitations mentioned above.
