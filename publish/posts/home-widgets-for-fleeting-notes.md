Let me get this straight, I love [[notes/link-based note-taking app|link-based note-taking apps]], the features, the plugins, and the community. Everything is fantastic, [[posts/put-quick-notes-into-obsidian-from-anywhere|except for the speed of taking notes]]. For this reason, many people use other apps for quick capture (e.g. Apple Notes, Google Keep).

These apps solve the problem of quick capture, but, don't integrate well with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (I use Obsidian personally). Since I'm not up for manually transferring notes from a quick capture app to Obsidian, I decided to create an alternative: Fleeting Notes. Fleeting Notes is essentially [[posts/imagine-google-keep-with-obsidian-sync|Google Keep but with wikilinks and Obsidian integration]].

Recently, I made a poll in my discord channel to ask for what features to add. To my surprise, a feature that I didn't even put on the list won the poll by an overwhelming amount: home screen widgets. Since it was so popular, I figured that people within the Obsidian community might benefit from a post like this.

## How to add a home widget and set up sync

1. [[publish/download|Download]] Fleeting Notes on your device (iOS or Android)
2. Add the home widget on [iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT207122) or [Android](https://support.google.com/android/answer/9450271?hl=en#zippy=)
3. Install the Fleeting Notes plugin within Obsidian and [[posts/sync-fleeting-notes-with-obsidian|set up sync]], or just setup [[posts/alternative-sync-local-only-for-fn|local sync with the filesystem]]
4. Take notes from the home widget and watch them populate in Obsidian

## A small but IMPORTANT caveat
If you decide to use Fleeting Notes **across multiple platforms**, you'll be forced to re-login when switching between devices. To avoid re-logging in when switching devices, you'll need to [subscribe](https://fleetingnotes.app/pricing) to the basic plan.
