title: "How I Publish Obsidian Notes for my Landing Page (Next.JS & Tailwind CSS)"
date: 2022-12-24

I wanted to create a website for [Fleeting Notes](https://www.fleetingnotes.app/) that reflected the interconnected nature of Obsidian, with [[bi-directional-links|bi-directional links]] and interlinked blog posts. However, I struggled to find a platform that met all my requirements:

- Support for Obsidian's `![[]]` syntax and other basic markdown
- Customization using ReactJS
- A straightforward publishing process.

That's why I built my own system using Next.JS and Tailwind CSS. My ultimate goal was to be able to publish my notes from an Obsidian Vault with a single command. I also wanted to make it easy for others to do the same, so I made the system [open-source and available as a template](https://github.com/matthewwong525/linked-blog-starter).
