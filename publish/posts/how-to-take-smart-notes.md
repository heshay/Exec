The [[illusion-of-competence|illusion of competence]] - we've all been there. Reading an insightful book, highlighting key points, underlying keywords, yet struggling to explain what we've just learned moments later. This frustration is the illusion of competence, a phenomenon where our note-taking methods deceive us into thinking we've grasped new information while our brain idles.

But what if we told you there's a fix? The solution lies in **taking smart notes**. Adopted by luminaries like [Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci) and [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann), smart notes not only help in retaining information but also foster critical thinking.

## What Makes Smart Notes 'Smart'?

### 1. Active Smart Notes

Smart notes are active; they're not passive highlights and underlines that merely follow the author's flow. Instead, smart notes involve actively restructuring other people's thoughts into your own structure. One effective method is the **[[qec-method|Q/E/C]] (Question, Evidence, Conclusion)** note-taking structure. Regardless of the order the author presents their ideas, the Q/E/C structure allows for a consistent method to extract and link the main points together.

### 2. Atomic Smart Notes

The second element that sets smart notes apart is their '[[atomic notes|atomic]]' nature. Instead of lumping notes into one giant document, each idea on a smart note stands independently. This atomic approach allows for 3D thinking, linking ideas in various directions and placing them in a context, turning the notes into a dynamic latticework of interlinked ideas.

### 3. Connected Smart Notes

Lastly, smart notes are interconnected. They are linked to existing knowledge, enabling us to combat the illusion of competence effectively. A powerful technique to achieve this is the **Compass of Zettelkasten Thinking**, which prompts four perspectives on an idea: its origin, its similarities to other ideas, competing ideas, and future implications. 

In summary, smart notes are active, atomic, and interconnected. They represent a potent tool for understanding and retaining complex information, making us better thinkers, learners, and communicators.
