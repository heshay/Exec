## Taking quick notes
Obsidian isn't great for quick notes. There's [[posts/put-quick-notes-into-obsidian-from-anywhere|additional friction]] in taking quick notes especially on the mobile app. But, the plugin architecture and backlink support make Obsidian a powerful note-taking tool that's customizable to one's needs. 

On the other hand, Google Keep is a great note-taking application for jotting quick notes. However, it lacks backlink support and is not nearly as customizable as Obsidian.

Each [[notes/use the right tool for the job|serve it's own purpose]], but there's a great opportunity here, and that is: **quick notes with hassle-free sync to Obsidian**.  

## Bi-directional sync with Fleeting Notes
As of 0.2.0 [Fleeting Notes](https://fleetingnotes.app) now supports bi-directional sync with Obsidian through the [[posts/sync-fleeting-notes-with-obsidian|Fleeting Notes Plugin]]. Notes updated in Fleeting Notes will be synced to Obsidian and vice versa. To enable this functionality, go to the plugin settings and set the sync type to "Two-way sync".

**Note**: If you've already installed the plugin you may need to reset the note template so it contains all the metadata needed for sync.

Here's a 5 second video of me updating the plugin settings:
