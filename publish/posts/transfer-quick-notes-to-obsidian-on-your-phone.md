Are you tired of waiting for Obsidian to load?

Well wait no longer! Because Fleeting Notes provides a quick and easy way to take quick notes and have them automatically synced to Obsidian. Combined with a multitude of features you know and love from Obsidian, Fleeting Notes will fit perfectly into your workflow. To list a few:

- Blazing-fast launch speeds to take note of your fleeting ideas
- Autocomplete wikilinks to help build your network of ideas
- A link-first UI to make link traversal silky smooth
- [[posts/end-to-end-encryption-in-fleeting-notes|End-to-end encryption]] so you can be confident of the security of your notes
- To top it off, an Obsidian plugin to keep your [[posts/sync-fleeting-notes-with-obsidian|Fleeting Notes in sync with Obsidian]].

Fleeting Notes came from a [[posts/put-quick-notes-into-obsidian-from-anywhere|personal pain point with taking quick notes in Obsidian]] and has evolved to the app you see now. I hope this app can also help you as well.
