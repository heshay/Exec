If you've read my [[posts/alternative-sync-local-only-for-fn|post about local sync]], I've talked a lot about the new local sync feature. But one big problem with this is the inability to interact with local files from within the browser. This makes it impossible to sync notes locally on the web version of Fleeting Notes.

So I decided it was time to add desktop support for Fleeting Notes. This is no small undertaking and it'll involve overhauling the existing infrastructure within Fleeting Notes. Over the last week, I've been iteratively migrating small pieces of the application to the new infrastructure. With this new infrastructure, it'll improve performance and make it a lot easier to release new features faster. 

[[posts/roadmap|After the desktop application]], I'm going to experiment with note-sharing, better markdown support, and two-way sync support. Of course, all of these changes are tentative and dependent on user feedback.
