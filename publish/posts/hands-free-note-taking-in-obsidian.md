I often have great ideas strike me at the most inconvenient times, like when I'm driving or cooking and my hands are full. In the past, I used to let those ideas pass or quickly jot them down in my notes app, only to forget to transfer them to my Obsidian later on.

But now, thanks to [Fleeting Notes](https://www.fleetingnotes.app/) - an app I actually created myself - I can capture my ideas completely hands-free and sync them directly to my Obsidian vault.

Now here's how to set it up on Android: ([video](https://youtu.be/1MudIgzjwiU))
1. Download the Fleeting Notes app
2. [[sync-fleeting-notes-with-obsidian|Setup the Fleeting Notes Sync Plugin]]
