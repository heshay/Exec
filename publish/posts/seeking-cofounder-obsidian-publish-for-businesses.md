title: "Seeking a Technical Co-founder: Obsidian Publish Alternative for Businesses"

Hello there! As the creator of [Fleeting Notes](https://www.fleetingnotes.app/), a note-taking app designed to capture bite-sized information into Obsidian, I'm on the hunt for a **technical co-founder**.

I envision us working parallelly. While I continue shaping Fleeting Notes, you'll be molding an innovative productâ€”an Obsidian Publish alternative, tailored for businesses. When the time comes, we'll part ways as separate companies. Sounds exciting, right?

Here's the deal: You'll walk away with a whopping 90% of the company, with me retaining 10%. But what's more?

- **Instant customer base**: Starting with me and Fleeting Notes.
- **Mentorship**: You'll have a friend and mentor to navigate tricky waters.
- **Knowledge Transfer**: I'll offer my expertise and experience from growing Fleeting Notes.
- **Implementation Ideas**: I can lend my ideas for the solution if you're up for it.
- **Technical help**: I'll help with technical issues if they arise

## Reinventing Documentation with an Obsidian Publish Alternative

Why take this path? It's simple, really. I'm a firm believer in the power of [[atomic notes]], and I see the potential to apply these concepts to business operations.

Our new venture is set to revolutionize business documentation:

-   A **centralized place in Obsidian** for all your documentation needs.
-   Harness Obsidian's **powerful linking features**.
-   **Share documents online** directly from Obsidian.
-   **Fully customize** the website's aesthetics with React.
-   **Backlinks** on the website, even outside markdown files.

## My MVP: linked-blog-starter

The proof of concept? I've already designed a custom solution, an MVP, for the Fleeting Notes website, called the [linked-blog-starter](https://linked-blog-starter.vercel.app/home). The best part? It's completely open source! Though my commitments with Fleeting Notes leave me little time for upkeep, the linked-blog-starter has thrived, growing organically, reinforcing my belief that it can open new avenues for Obsidian MD in businesses.
