In the upcoming version of [Fleeting Notes](https://fleetingnotes.app/) (v0.5.0), local sync is going to make an appearance! In other words, notes taken will automatically be synced to local storage specified by you. That's cool and all, but what does that mean for you?

First off, it means that your notes are automatically backed up locally. This means that even if you uninstalled Fleeting Notes, notes will be stored in markdown files in your local storage. A second advantage is that other local markdown note-taking applications (Obsidian, Logseq, etc.) can automatically read and take advantage of the local notes stored on your device.

One common use case is to use Fleeting Notes to take quick notes, have them synced locally, then use an external sync provider (e.g. [SyncThing](https://syncthing.net/), or [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync)) to propagate the local notes across multiple platforms. 

Anyways, it'd be awesome if you guys gave tried it out and let me know what you think of it! I never want to lose sight of what's valuable to you guys.
