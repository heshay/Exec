If you're a fan of Google Keep, you know how useful it can be for capturing quick notes and ideas on the go. But what if you could take the convenience of Google Keep and combine it with the powerful organization and structure of Obsidian? That's where [Fleeting Notes](https://www.fleetingnotes.app/) comes in.

## What is Fleeting Notes?
I created Fleeting Notes as a note-taking app that is similar to Google Keep in many ways. It allows me to quickly jot down ideas, thoughts, and to-dos in a fast and effortless manner, and it's accessible from any device (even as a [browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fleeting-notes/gcplhmogdjioeaenmehmapbdonklmdnc)).

But where Fleeting Notes really stands out is in its ability to automatically [[Setup local file sync|sync with Obsidian completely offline]], thanks to its local file storage sync feature. This means that I can access and edit my Fleeting Notes even when I'm not connected to the internet, just like I can with Google Keep.

But Fleeting Notes is not just a simple note-taking app. It also has a focus on building connections within my notes, similar to the concept of a "[[slip-box|slip box]]" popularized by [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann). This means that I can easily link related notes together and build a personal knowledge base, just like I can in Obsidian.

## Syncing FN with Obsidian
So how do I use Fleeting Notes with Obsidian? There are two methods:

1. Enable [[how-to-setup-local-file-sync|offline local file sync]] in Fleeting Notes and sync it with your Obsidian vault (Android Only)
2. Download the Obsidian plugin and [[sync-fleeting-notes-with-obsidian|sync notes over the cloud]].

Using Fleeting Notes in tandem with Obsidian allows me to take advantage of the strengths of both tools. I can use Fleeting Notes for quick note-taking on the go, just like I can with Google Keep, and then use Obsidian to organize and structure my notes in a more meaningful way.

Overall, Fleeting Notes is the perfect solution for anyone looking for a fast, flexible, and reliable way to capture quick notes with [[bi-directional-links|backlinks]] and offline sync to Obsidian. Give it a try and see for yourself how it can revolutionize your note-taking workflow!
