**Note**: Local file sync is **unavailable on the web** due to browser restrictions and the recommended approach is with [[Setup Obsidian cloud sync|cloud sync]]. 

1.  Navigate to the app's settings by opening the drawer and clicking on "Settings".
2.  Select a "Sync folder location".
3.  Toggle the "Enabled" switch to turn on local sync.
4.  (Optional) Adjust the "Sync type" and "Note template" to your liking.
