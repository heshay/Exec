## Enabling E2EE in Fleeting Notes
1. Navigate to the settings in the Fleeting Notes application 
2. Find "End-to-end Encryption" and click the "Enable" button
3. Type in your encryption password (**Note**: you cannot change this password, and if you forget this password, data will remain unusable forever)
4. Click "Ok"

Then you're done! End-to-end encryption is enabled. From now on, notes that are saved will be encrypted on the server. Unaccessible by me or anyone without your custom encryption key. 

**Note**: previous notes won't be retroactively encrypted

## E2EE with the Obsidian plugin
1. Navigate to the settings of the plugin
2. Type the same encryption key you used for in the Fleeting Notes application
3. Perform the sync!
