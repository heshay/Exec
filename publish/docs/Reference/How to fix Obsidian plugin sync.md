There could be a number of reasons as to why the sync doesn't work. Here are some steps to follow to ensure the sync works as expected. 

## If you haven't gotten sync to work
1. Navigate to the plugin settings and check that the email, password. Ensure there is no whitespace
2. If you've enabled encryption in the app ensure that you have the encryption key in the plugin settings
3. If you haven't already try changing the "Sync type" to one-way sync
4. Try sync again

## Changing from one-way sync to two-way sync
1. If two-way sync is enabled, ensure that the note-template is the default note template. You can refresh the template with the button beside it.
2. Once the above steps are done, try deleting all your Fleeting Notes. Then run the sync command to pull all the notes to a specified folder.
3. Try sync again
