## Understanding the UI

Navigating Fleeting Notes' interface is designed to be intuitive, but let's take a closer look at some key components to help you get familiar.

### Dashboard

The Dashboard is the first screen you encounter when you launch Fleeting Notes. Here, you will find:

- **Recent Notes**: A list of your most recently accessed or edited notes is displayed for quick retrieval.

#### Search Bar
The Search Bar isn't just a standard search field; it's a powerful tool that allows you to:

- **Search and Sort**: You can search your notes based on different criteria such as 'Created At,' 'Modified At,' 'Title,' 'Content,' and 'Source.'
  
- **Filter Results**: You have the option to narrow down your search by focusing on specific elements like the title, content, or source of a note.

#### New Note Button

The New Note Button serves multiple functions:

- **Quick Note Creation**: A simple tap opens up the [[Editor|Editor]] where you can jot down your ideas.
  
- **Browser Extension Features**: If you’re using Fleeting Notes as a browser extension, tapping this button will populate the 'Source' field with the URL of the tab you currently have open.
  
- **Voice-to-Text**: A long press on the button activates audio capture, which is then transcribed into text for you.

#### Settings Menu

Located as a gear icon, the Settings Menu is your go-to for personalization and configuration options. Navigate to [[Settings|Settings]] for:

- **Sync Options**: Configure your note sync settings across devices.
  
- **Add-Ons and Extensions**: Manage additional features or services you’ve enabled.
