# Prioritizing User Privacy in Fleeting Notes
As the creator of Fleeting Notes, a note-taking app designed to reduce the time it takes to create notes in Obsidian MD, I've always been deeply concerned about user privacy and ensuring that personal data is protected. Gathering feedback is extremely important, but I've observed that users often don't understand the full implication of their data being collected. This lack of understanding can lead to unethical and invasive practices, which I feel strongly against.

Note-taking is a highly personal experience, and having in-app analytics can make people wary. I want my users to feel comfortable and secure using Fleeting Notes, without worrying about their personal information being collected and used in ways they may not fully understand. It's a matter of trust, and I believe that by respecting users' privacy, we can create a strong bond and provide a better user experience.

With these concerns in mind, I've made the decision to remove in-app analytics from Fleeting Notes. I believe this is the right thing to do, both ethically and practically. Instead, I've chosen to use [Wiredash](https://wiredash.io/) as a means to gather feedback from users.

In today's world, especially with the advent of AI tools, data is increasingly becoming more and more powerful. As a result, having control of personal data is becoming increasingly more important. By removing in-app analytics, I aim to empower Fleeting Notes users by giving them control over their personal data and reinforcing their trust in my app.

I hope that this decision will resonate with my users and that, together, we can create a more privacy-focused note-taking experience. As always, I am grateful for your support, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts on this change. Please feel free to share your feedback and suggestions with me, as your input is invaluable in helping me shape the future of Fleeting Notes.

# What's new and what's to come
For the past two weeks, I've been working out a lot of little small kinks to improve the overall experience when using Fleeting Notes. I'm excited for you to try these new changes when they are released :)

## Released / In the next Release
- [Desktop Support](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/186): Access Fleeting Notes directly from a native app on your Windows or Mac computer
- [Slightly better markdown editor](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/pull/565): Integrating a fully fledged markdown editor is a lot of work. But for now, I wanted to release a slightly better MD editor for your typing needs!
- [Image attachments automatically downloaded in the Obsidian plugin](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-obsidian/issues/74): Images uploaded to your notes can now be downloaded
- Plus a whole lot of bug fixes and small quality of life improvements!

## Upcoming
- [Provide in-app feedback](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/564): Easily provide feedback to me within Fleeting Notes!
- [Markdown rich text editor](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/536): Add support for markdown tools to make editing a breeze!
- [Tag autocomplete](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/138): Similar to links when pressing `[[`. An essential feature if you are a frequent user of tags.
- [OCR / Image-to-text](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/531): Take an image, share it to Fleeting Notes, then have the text within the image transcribed into text accessible within Obsidian. 
- And other feature requests made by you! (e.g. by replying to this email)

# An Update for my startup:
Hey there, it's been a slower couple of weeks for me, and that's because I've been focusing on developing new features for my app Fleeting Notes. As the creator of Fleeting Notes, I'm constantly looking for ways to improve my workflow and make my work more efficient. And one of the ways I'm doing that is by buying into the AI hype.

I know AI is all the rage these days, but I truly believe that it can help me work faster and more efficiently. From content creation and marketing to coding, I'm exploring ways to integrate AI into my workflow and see what it can do for me. And once I improve myself, I can improve Fleeting Notes at breakneck speeds.

But that's not all. I've also applied to the startup accelerator YCombinator. I'm hoping to get an interview in the coming month, and if I get in, you can expect even bigger changes within Fleeting Notes. In the meantime, I've set a goal for myself to reach 1000 active subscribers by the end of the year.

Now, I haven't really set up any real goals apart from that one, so I decided to create an exponential trajectory to reach 1000 active subscribers by the end of the year. According to my calculations, by the time I write my next newsletter on April 24th (ish), I should have 156 active subscribers. I'm excited to see how this trajectory will unfold and hope to report back with good news in just two weeks.

If you're curious, here's the one-minute pitch I made to apply for YCombinator:
