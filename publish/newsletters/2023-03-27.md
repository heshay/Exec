A new way to add notes into Obsidian:

- **Hey Siri/Google, Record New Note.** Now within the Fleeting Notes app, it is possible to record notes *completely hands-free*. I have no doubt this will supercharge any workflow!
- **Desktop Support, Append note to same source, Image-to-text** and more. Based on feedback from you, I've been working on new features I know you'll love!
- **A personal update: Thank you for your glowing support.** I'm still pushing hard towards my goal of 1000 active subscribers and I'm super thankful for the positive messages I've received. I will continue to keep a tight line of communication with community :)

# What's new and what's to come
For the past two weeks, I've been churning out new features and here's a summary of some of the things I've been working on. I actually had no idea there would be such high demand for "[Append text to notes with the same source](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/462)" but I was able to gauge that thanks to a helpful [discord](https://discord.gg/xrj6yuGNmx) poll:

If you have any feature requests, don't hesitate to reply to this email and let me know what you'd like. Bonus points if you can describe the problem this feature would help with ;)

## Released / In the next Release
- [Speech-to-text support](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/529): This is already mentioned below but I thought it'd be cool to put it in here.
- [Append text to notes with the same source](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/462): Now, you finally don't need to take multiple notes for one source!
- [Access to source metadata from within Obsidian](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-obsidian/issues/63): Now you can access source metadata values through the `source_title`, `source_description` and `source_image_url` variable in the note template
- [No longer require 3rd party cookies](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/520): The sidebar in the browser extension requires third party cookies. So by default I've changed the sidebar to a popup instead. That being said, it is possible to re-enable the sidebar by right clicking the extension icon.

## Upcoming
- [Desktop Support](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/186): Access Fleeting Notes directly from a native app in your desktop.
- [Markdown rich text editor](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/536): Add support for markdown tools to make editing a breeze!
- [Tag autocomplete](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/138): Similar to links when pressing `[[`. An essential feature if you are a frequent user of tags.
- [OCR / Image-to-text](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/531): Take an image, share it to Fleeting Notes, then have the text within the image transcribed into text accessible within Obsidian. 
- [Image attachments automatically downloaded in the Obsidian plugin](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-obsidian/issues/74): Right now, the sources are stored in a URL. It's often desireable to have them downloaded to the vault to be stored locally. 
- And other feature requests made by you! (e.g. by replying to this email)

# Personal Update
  
Last week, I shared the exciting news that I'm quitting my job to pursue Fleeting Notes full-time. The response has been overwhelmingly positive, and I'm incredibly grateful for all the glowing replies. I can't express how much joy these messages have brought me. Thank you so much, everyone.

What's more, the support has led to a significant increase in subscribers. It's clear that people appreciate when the developer is closely connected to the community, and I plan to keep it this way as long as I can.

In the past week, I've been thinking a lot about the direction I want to take Fleeting Notes and what I need to do to achieve my goals. I've decided to focus on one simple mission: drastically reducing the time it takes to take meaningful notes. Everything I do from now on will serve this mission, and having this singular focus makes it easier to direct my efforts towards what matters most to my customers.

At present, Fleeting Notes looks like an "Apple Notes" that syncs with Obsidian. But in 10 years, it could be a thought directly sent to Obsidian without even needing a phone to interface (via Neuralink). It's a scary thought to consider what the future may hold, but I'm excited to keep exploring new possibilities.

Currently, I have 124 active subscribers, up from 110 two weeks ago. With the upcoming new feature of hands-free note-taking, things are looking promising. While Obsidian doesn't support this yet, I think it will be a significant selling point. I'll keep everyone updated on any new developments. Thanks for reading!
