# What's new and what's to come
For the past week, I've poured a good portion of my time in developing a [new plugin system](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-plugins) for Fleeting Notes. Similar to Obsidian, this plugin system will allow the community (and me) to extend the functionality of Fleeting Notes. I'm so excited to add new plugins that I even decided to hire someone out to help me develop new plugins!

That being said, I've neglected a few quality of life features users have been requesting, and now I'll be working hard to address those in the coming weeks.

## Released / In the next Release
- [Removing the save button](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/592): The save button has been around for a while and with features like auto-save it has become redundant and confusing.
- [Share notes with other sources](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/585): Share text to other apps like how you'd do in other apps
- [Font size scaling](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/566): If you want to adjust the font size, the text scale slider will help you do so!
- [Better title field](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/638): The title field is automatically focused when creating a new note & will go to the content field on enter.
- Plus a few bug fixes and small quality of life improvements!

## Upcoming
- [Global Shortcut Keys](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/613): Allows for users to open Fleeting Notes directly from the desktop through shortcut keys
- [Text-to-speech to support different languages](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/598): Text to speech to support different languages
- [Record notes & add attachments from main screen](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/630): With this feature it makes it one-tap to record a note or add an attachment to Fleeting Notes!
- Send to... (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Github, [Notion](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-plugins/issues/3), etc.): Send directly to any service from a simple command all within Fleeting Notes.

# Personal Update: Becoming a Manager
I've always loved the thrill of diving headfirst into every nook and cranny of my business. I mean, who doesn't like getting their hands a little dirty, right? But I've had a realization recently - there's a limit to how much one person can do. If I spend all my energy working _in_ my business, I can't spare any to work _on_ growing my business. You see the conundrum here?

So, I've decided to turn the page. I've just brought aboard my very first team member, to take some of the weight off my shoulders. For now, they're part-timing, but who knows? This move could be the key that frees up my time to focus on expanding Fleeting Notes.

Also, I have some personal news. Ever since I left my full-time job to follow my entrepreneurial dreams, things got a bit...lonely. I'd find myself wishing I had someone to talk to about the ups and downs of the startup life. But recently, I've found my tribe - a group of friends who are also navigating the wild world of startups. It's amazing, really. Trading stories, comparing notes, and learning from each other's experiences...it's something special.

Alright, let's talk about Fleeting Notes now. How's it been going, you ask? Well, progress has been steady. I'd love to tell you that we're skyrocketing towards stardom, but let's keep it real - growing a business is tough, especially in the consumer segment. We've chosen the hard mode, and it's living up to its name.

As of now, we have 150 active subscribers (yay!). That's one more than two weeks ago, which might not sound like much, but hey, growth is growth. Still, I can't help but eye that goal of 207 subscribers that I'd set, which leaves us 57 short. Why 207, you ask? Well, that's the stepping stone I've identified towards the ultimate goal of hitting 1,000 subscribers by month's end.

But worry not, we're not just sitting here twiddling our thumbs. We're actively experimenting with a plethora of strategies. New landing pages, optimizing our app store presence, and much more are on the table. Who knows? Maybe one of these experiments will be the secret ingredient we need to kick things up a notch. Fingers crossed!
