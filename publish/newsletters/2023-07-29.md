Here's the latest edition of my bi-weekly newsletter.

- **Finished more stuff you requested.** I've been tackling more features and bug requests directly from your feedback. Although I'd still love to hear more!
- **My content creation workflow.** How I setup my content creation pipeline which can be useful on how you shape yours.
- **Personal Update:** I've finally come to narrow down the value in Fleeting Notes and with your feedback I will drive the development forward.

# What's new and what's to come
So thank you to the people that [setup a call with me](https://usemotion.com/meet/ithinkwong/meeting?d=30). I got lots of great insights from the calls and I'm ready to improve the app more. 

## Released / In the next Release
- [New settings screen](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/pull/724): I'm adding a lot of configuration to be able to capture exactly the way you like it. This clutters the settings screen and so I'm planning on updating the UI for the settings.
- [Plugin selector](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/pull/720): Now you can select which plugins you want to use all within the app!
- [Preview markdown](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/pull/737): Now you can toggle a markdown preview to see what your notes will look like in markdown!
- [Updated settings page](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/pull/724): As more customization options were being added, the settings page was getting cluttered. With this change, the settings screen is more usable. 

## Upcoming
- [Update the mobile toolbar](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/677): Add undo & redo buttons, add slash commands, and upload attachments from the toolbar!
- [Single touch links & tags](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/723): Add links and tags with a single tap straight from the mobile toolbar
- [Support sublists](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/692): Better use sublists from within the Fleeting Notes editor

# My Content Creation Workflow
Today, I'm thrilled to pull back the curtain and give you a glimpse into my creative process. I'll walk you through how I create content using my own creation, the Fleeting Notes app. My hope is that this might just shed some light on how you could shape your note-taking habits. So let's dive in!

## A Brief on My Workflow

Everything starts with [Fleeting Notes](https://www.fleetingnotes.app/). Whenever an idea pops into my head, I open the Fleeting Notes app and quickly jot it down, making sure to add a tag. It's like capturing butterflies of inspiration before they flutter away!

What makes it even more awesome is the [[sync-fleeting-notes-with-obsidian|synchronization setup with Obsidian]]. My notes from Fleeting Notes seamlessly sync with Obsidian, ensuring my thoughts are always accessible and organized.

When it's time to create some content, I just take a glance at my dashboard. It's like my mission control center, filled with a collection of dataview queries showing me which tasks need to be tackled. Once I finish a task and check it off, the 2-way sync magic happens, and voila, it's automatically checked off in Fleeting Notes too. Here's an example of what one of my dataview query looks:
````
```dataview
TASK
FROM "FleetingNotesApp"
WHERE !completed
```
````
The above query captures all uncompleted tasks created tasks within my Fleeting Notes. In here I typically put all my content ideas. I mark it as completed once I created the content. 

## Crafting the Content

Next up is the writing process. Picture my Obsidian as a well-sorted library. I have multiple folders, each representing a different type of content:

- `docs`: These are my go-to instruction manuals, step-by-step guides on how to do something.
- `newsletters`: Bi-weekly missives that I dispatch to my eager readers.
- `posts`: Where my blog post masterpieces reside.
- `attachments`: The storage spot for images or PDF files that I attach to notes.

When it's time to publish something, I create the file in the appropriate folder. As I write, I'm constantly on the lookout for potential atomic notes. If a piece of content can be repurposed in another blog, docs, or newsletter, I ensure that I add a header to the content so that it can be [referenced using headers](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links#Link+to+a+heading+in+a+note). 

Note: Sometimes I'll write a newsletter, use the note refactor feature, and boom â€” it's also a shiny new blog post!

## Publishing the Content
Now, you must be wondering how I go about publishing my content. Well, after trying many solutions and even creating my own, I've found a sweet spot with the new update on [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish). It offers graph view, customizations, SEO, and much more, which makes it pretty darn convenient.

However, if you're a customization enthusiast and enjoy the challenge of creating your own blog from scratch, I'd highly recommend going for [obsidian-digital-garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden). Yes, the setup is a bit more complicated, but it offers fantastic customization options and is free!

At the end of the day, with Obsidian Publish, you're paying for convenience. But remember, convenience is not a one-size-fits-all thing, and there's a certain joy in building something that's entirely your own.

So there you have it, my note-taking to content creation workflow! If there's one thing I hope you take away, it's that note-taking can be flexible, personalized, and even fun. Whether you use Fleeting Notes or not, I hope this has given you some food for thought.
