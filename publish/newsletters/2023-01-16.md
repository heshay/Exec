This is the start of my newsletter and **will be the last newsletter you receive unless you subscribe**. In this newsletter, I'll be sharing note worthy articles relevant to Fleeting Notes as well as an inside look at the direction I'm planning to take the app in the future.

- **I've recently [[open-source-software|open sourced]] Fleeting Notes and made the [code](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter) available to everyone.** See my journey that brought me to this decision below.  
- **A sneak peak on the fresh UI** and the steps needed to release a full 1.0 release of Fleeting Notes. 
- **Stagnating at $300 / month from Fleeting Notes** and my plan to break this stagnation

# A sneak peak on the fresh UI

After conducting a poll in my Discord community, I realized that the most sought-after feature was a more user-friendly interface. So, I put my pride aside and set out to create a new UI for the application. The challenge was that I am not a UI designer by trade.

To overcome this obstacle, I decided to emulate [a mail app from the Material Design website](https://m3.material.io/foundations/adaptive-design/overview#af47d26b-4a35-4c13-8854-01343ab35404) as a starting point. While this provided a solid foundation, there were still some missing elements that I couldn't transfer from the mail app to my own design. For those areas, I looked to other apps like Google Keep and Raindrop for inspiration. It was definitely a learning experience, but I am now nearing the finish line and I am eager to hear your thoughts on the new design. Below is a sample of what I have so far. Please keep in mind that this is not the final product and I welcome any feedback you may have. Simply hit the reply button and let me know your thoughts!

# Stagnating at $300 / month
As the creator of Fleeting Notes, I've been closely monitoring the growth of my application since its inception. Unfortunately, I've noticed that my explosive growth has plateaued and even dipped a bit. Currently, my [[monthly-recurring-revenue|monthly recurring revenue]] (MRR) sits at around $288. You might be wondering what caused this decline and where it all began.

In October, I performed a [[migrating-from-firebase-to-supabase|migration]] that unfortunately introduced a few bugs into the app. These bugs caused me to lose a few users and negatively impacted my [[conversion-rate|conversion rate]]. For the following two months, I focused on fixing these bugs and improving the stability of Fleeting Notes by adding a more comprehensive test suite. But since the end of December, I've been feeling more confident in the stability of my application. Even in my charts, it's clear to see that my MRR has been reflecting that.

Now, I'm at a point where I'm confident in the stability of the application, and I'm shifting my focus to improving the user experience and adding key new features. In the coming months, I'm planning to release a 1.0 version of Fleeting Notes, and before that, I want to complete two main things: improve the UI and create a developer-friendly plugin framework.

The reason I want to focus on these two features in particular is that the UI definitely needs a major improvement, as stated before. The plugin framework, on the other hand, will make it easy to extend Fleeting Notes for specific use cases. For example, a command to:

-   Copy a note to any other cloud service (e.g. Notion, Twitter, Facebook, etc.)
-   Merge notes with the same source
-   Send the contents of a note to ChatGPT

These are just a few plugin ideas off the top of my head, but I believe it will open up a lot more opportunities in terms of customizability without cluttering the UI for users who don't enable the plugins.

That's a wrap-up for this week's newsletter. If you have any thoughts you'd like to share, please don't hesitate to hit the reply button and reach out to me.
