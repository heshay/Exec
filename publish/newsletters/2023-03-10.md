I finally took the leap and quit my job! See what I've been up to since:

- **A shiny new UI** built for taking quick notes effortlessly and a bit of my rambling on becoming a "legit" startup
- **What's coming next:** Speech-to-text, Desktop support, and more!
- **Leaving my full-time job** to pursue my passion project - Fleeting Notes. Plus, a new goal of 1000 active subscribers by the end of the year!

## A fresh new look
I am thrilled to announce the latest update to Fleeting Notes! Over the past few weeks, I've been working closely with a UI/UX designer to provide a better note-taking experience that's fully geared towards taking fleeting notes.

The purpose of Fleeting Notes is to take quick notes, so I wanted to make the note-taking experience as frictionless as possible. You'll notice a more intuitive and streamlined interface that allows you to jot down your thoughts quickly and effortlessly. The new UI is designed with you in mind, with features that make it easy to take notes on the go and access them later.

I am proud to say that the new UI feels like a total rebrand. Before, the app was a scrappy tool, but with the new UI, I now think it's more "legit." It gives me more confidence to recommend the application and even ask people to review it. With the new UI, I believe Fleeting Notes is now more approachable and user-friendly than ever before. So, go ahead and check out the [new UI](https://my.fleetingnotes.app/) today! I am confident that you'll love the new look and feel of Fleeting Notes.

Keep in mind, this all started with a poll on Discord, where you guys overwhelmingly pushed for a better UI. As a solo developer, your feedback is incredibly valuable to me. So feel free to provide your suggestions and feedback. A simple reply can go a long way! I will continue to work hard to make Fleeting Notes the best app for taking quick notes.

Thank you for your continued support, and happy note-taking!

## What's coming next
- [Voice Assistant -> Note.](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/529) Ideas pop into our heads at odd times, and sometimes we need to a way to take notes hands-free (e.g. driving).  
- [Desktop support.](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/186) To access Fleeting Notes directly from a native app.
- [Source metadata available within the Obsidian plugin](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-obsidian/issues/63). Gives access to the source title, description, and image preview as variables within the note template.
- And other feature requests made by you ðŸ«µ  (e.g. by replying to this email)

## Leaving my full-time job to pursue my passion project in the middle of a recession!
I've been thinking about leaving my job for a while now and I've finally made the decision to take the leap. Balancing my full-time job and working on my passion project, Fleeting Notes, has become too much to handle. It's time for me to fully focus on what I love doing.

With more time to work on Fleeting Notes, I'll be able to take it to the next level. I'll be able to finish projects that I've been meaning to do, be more responsive to customer inquiries, and provide a better overall experience for my customers. I'm super passionate about this and I'm excited for what's to come.

You might be wondering, am I worried about the recession? We're currently in a recession, but I'm incredibly thankful for the support of my family and friends. I wouldn't have been able to make this leap without them. Plus, I believe that now is the best time to quit because I'm still young and have relatively few responsibilities.

If you want to chat more about my decision, feel free to reply to this post or shoot me a DM. It'd be my pleasure to talk more about myself.

### Metrics Update
In terms of my metric update for Fleeting Notes, I'm excited to share that my active subscriber count has increased to 110, up from 103 in February. I firmly believe that this growth is due to the app's improved stability and revamped UI, which I've tirelessly worked on to provide users with a seamless and enjoyable experience. As a result, my efforts are finally paying off.

Looking forward, my ultimate goal for the year is to achieve a comfortable living income through Fleeting Notes. To make this a reality, I've set my sights on reaching 1000 subscribers. It's an ambitious target, but I'm up for the challenge and can't wait to see what the future holds.
