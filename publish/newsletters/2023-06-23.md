# Fleeting Notes - Now in Your Browser Sidebar!
Have you ever noticed something new in your Chrome browser? Just like those secret menu items at your favorite cafe, our tech world often surprises us with hidden treasures. And this time, it's a shiny, new sidebar button in Chrome.

Yes, you read that right. A sidebar button has recently made its way into your everyday browsing life. But that's not where the fun ends. Chrome decided to go an extra mile and introduced an API, making it possible to add chrome extensions right inside that sidebar. How cool is that?

Well, you guessed it! I simply couldn't resist the temptation. So, I rolled up my sleeves and got to work. After a couple of late nights, a few cups of coffee, and a ton of code lines later, I'm beyond excited to introduce you to something I've been working on.

I've added **Fleeting Notes** to the Sidebar for Chrome & Firefox! Yes, your beloved note-taking app is now just a click away, comfortably nestled within the browser sidebar. And the best part? This sidebar smoothly persists across webpages without hovering annoyingly above the contentâ€”it graciously readjusts the web content to make room for itself. So, you've got your own neat corner to take quick notes while you surf the internet!

But wait, there's more! Here's something that absolutely blew my mind. You can even have the sidebar open while watching a YouTube video in full-screen. Isn't that absolutely crazy? It's like having popcorn while enjoying your favorite movie, without missing out on any details.

Now you might wonder, how do you get this awesome tool in your sidebar? It's simple. Just click on the sidebar button and select 'Fleeting Notes' in the dropdown. Voila! Your note-taking partner is ready to assist you.

For my Firefox folks out there, I've got you covered as well. You just need to add the sidebar button to your controls. Not sure how to do that? No worries! You can find easy instructions [right here](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-firefox-sidebar-access-bookmarks-history-synced).

With Fleeting Notes in your browser sidebar, capturing bite-sized information has never been easier. So, what are you waiting for? Give it a try, and let's make note-taking a breeze!


# Personal Update: My Roller Coaster Week
Hello there, folks! Boy, has this week been a whirlwind or what! First of all, I want to be honest with you, this week... it was a tough one for me.

You see, in my relentless pursuit of making Fleeting Notes the best note-taking app out there, I made a teeny-tiny hiccup. I accidentally released a version of the app that was - brace yourselves - broken! Oops! ðŸ˜…

However, fear not, my dear friends. I managed to patch up the mess and roll out a fixed version within a day. Phew! I really appreciated the patience and understanding from all of you. You guys rock!

Then came another hurdle. I decided to try and jazz up the editor part of the app. After hours of blood, sweat, and tears, it turned out... not as useful as I had hoped. It was one of those moments where you wonder if you've just lost track of whatâ€™s important.

I mean, in this wild world of app development, itâ€™s easy to forget whether what weâ€™re doing will actually make a difference. I found myself questioning my efforts and wondering if they'll prove helpful to you, my users.

That's why, in the upcoming weeks, my aim is to better understand YOU. What do you want from Fleeting Notes? How can I improve your experience? I want to focus on finding the right marketing strategy thatâ€™ll connect me with you even more.

That doesnâ€™t mean I'll stop making improvements, though. I still plan to work on smaller, quality of life improvements, but nothing too major for now. All in the name of making Fleeting Notes a better tool for your bite-sized info capturing needs!

On a brighter note, my efforts to earn more have been fruitful! In fact, I've been so successful that I can now afford to pay my very first employee, Gonzalo (Hi, Gonzalo ðŸ‘‹), with the goal of bringing him on board full time! So, a big thank you to the 20 people who have signed up for an annual subscription. Your support means the world to me.

And speaking of support, did you know that we're now at 158 active subscribers? Woah! Iâ€™m so grateful for each and every one of you. By speaking more with you lovely folks, Iâ€™m hoping to see our subscriber count increase even more by the next newsletter. So, donâ€™t be a stranger! Drop me a message, let me know what you think about Fleeting Notes.

Letâ€™s make this note-taking journey an exciting one together!
