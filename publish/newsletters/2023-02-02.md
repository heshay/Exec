Everything I work on *must* either reduce the friction in note-taking or make Fleeting Notes better integrate with your workflow. 

- **A new sidebar and a way to sync your Obsidian links to Fleeting Notes.** See the latest updates with what I've been working on and some new features I think you might find cool.
- **It takes time to build a new UI.** Follow my journey with building the new UI for Fleeting Notes with a sneak preview of what it might look like. 
- **A boost in revenue from $288 / month to $313 / month** and what it will take for me to quit my full-time job.

## Shiny New Features you may have been waiting for.
So while waiting on the UI design changes, I'll need to spend the other time working on other things that aren't related to my app. But, I'm excited to share with you the new feature about to be released: the browser extension sidebar! Rather than having an obtrusive popup in the browser extension, there is now a sleek sidebar that can be used to take notes. If the GIF below isn't enough of an intro, feel free to watch a [clip of me introducing the sidebar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxRQ3eWft3g) (3 min).

On top of adding the new sidebar feature, I've also added the ability to make [Obsidian backlinks popup as link suggestions](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-obsidian/issues/62). With this feature, you can see all the links as suggestions within Fleeting Notes! Checkout how to [[how-to-sync-obsidian-links-into-fleeting-notes|set that up below]]:

In addition to the above, I'm also working on adding these features in the coming week or so. Checkout [my roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/fleetingnotes/projects/1/) for the most up to date information:

- [Add safari browser extension support](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/180)
- [Fix bug where there is no error message on incorrect login](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/485)
- [Get metadata from source URL](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/484)

## A personal update: When will I quit my job?
![[mrr-update-313.png]]

Two weeks ago, I was roughly sitting at around $288 / month in [[monthly-recurring-revenue|recurring revenue]] and this week I've managed to increase that to $313 / month. I'm proud of the increase but it's not nearly at the levels needed to quit my full-time job. My goal is to generate around $1500 of monthly recurring revenue a month before I can comfortably quit my job and commit 100% of my working hours towards Fleeting Notes. Despite a tough goal, I'm aiming to reach this point by mid-2023. By this point I should have the [new UI design](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/391), an [extendable plugin system](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/414), and [desktop support](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/186).  

My hope is to make Fleeting Notes the absolute best companion app to Obsidian and other note-taking apps. 

Anyways, that's a wrap for this newsletter! Again, if you have any thoughts you'd like to share, please don't hesitate to hit the reply button and reach out to me.
