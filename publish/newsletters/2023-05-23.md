It's time to grow ;)
- **Open AI Integration, Image-to-text, Notion Integration,** and other quality of life improvements are incoming!
- **Looking for a cofounder** to help me build a Obsidian Publish alternative for businesses
- **I WANT TO GROW FLEETING NOTES** and make a positive impact on this world

# What's new and what's to come
I spent a lot more time than expected on getting this plugin functional command thing working. Thankfully it's almost through the door. Checkout the [plugin repo](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-plugins) for more info!

## Released / In the next Release
- [Plugin Functional Commands](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/414). This will unblock features like:
	- [Integration with Open AI and custom prompts:](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/604) Setup custom prompts and use ChatGPT right within Fleeting Notes.
	- [OCR / Image-to-text](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/531): Take an image, share it to Fleeting Notes, then have the text within the image transcribed into text accessible within Obsidian. 
	- Send to... (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Github, [Notion](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-plugins/issues/3), etc.): Send directly to any service from a simple command all within Fleeting Notes.
- [Sharing images + files into Fleeting Notes](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/183): Share images and files into Fleeting Notes on mobile devices.
- [Changing phone orientation removes unsaved notes](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/610): Fixing this annoying bug
- Plus a few bug fixes and small quality of life improvements!

## Upcoming
- [Removing the save button](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/592): The save button has been around for a while and with features like auto-save it has become redundant and confusing.
- [Share notes with other sources](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/585): Share text to other apps like how you'd do in other apps
- [Global Shortcut Keys](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/613): Allows for users to open Fleeting Notes directly from the desktop through shortcut keys

# Personal Update: Looking to Grow
I want to share with you a project that I care about a lot - Fleeting Notes. It's not just another business to me. I'm building it because I want to stand on my own two feet, change the world in some way, and solve a problem that's been bothering me for a long time. I'm all in on Fleeting Notes and want to see it succeed.

I even applied to YCombinator, hoping they could help me make Fleeting Notes big. But I haven't heard back from them yet. This has made me realize that something like YCombinator isn't the silver bullet to growing Fleeting Notes. It's a journey that I'll have to embark on myself. And the more I work on my project, the more I understand that there's no secret formula for success

This makes me wonder: Do I need to get the word out more? Should I add AI to Fleeting Notes? Should I collect more data about users to make better decisions? Should I talk to customers more? Do I need to organize my work better? Am I even trying to reach the right people?

Above all, I ask myself: What should I be working on to help Fleeting Notes grow the most?

I see other people in tech making a big splash, especially with AI, and sometimes I worry. Am I missing out on something? It's scary to think I might be spending all my time on something people don't want or need.

This week, I didn't do much advertising. I played around with making some TikToks and finished up a new feature that I hope will attract more people.

Right now, I have 149 active subscribers. That's 2 more than last week, but 37 less than my goal of 186. I'm planning to do better next week and hope to have some good news to share in my next newsletter.

(+ 19 Subscribers from iOS App Store)
