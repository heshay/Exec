### Pricing Changes on the Horizon ðŸŒ…

Now, onto some housekeeping notes. As of September 1st, there's going to be a slight adjustment in our pricing. The basic plan will see a hike from $2.5/month to $5/month, and the premium plan will jump from $5/month to $10/month.

For all my loyal subscribers out there, breathe easy. This is NOT going to affect you. This new pricing model will only be applicable to newcomers. Your current plan and price will remain locked in as my token of appreciation for your early support.

And hey, if you've been on the fence about upgrading, now might be your best shot before the new pricing comes into effect!

### The "Why" Behind the Decision ðŸ’­

You might be scratching your head, wondering, "Why the price increase?". Let me pull back the curtain a bit. Currently, I'm navigating the challenging waters of running this business at a loss. My incredible colleague, Gonzalo, has been an unsung hero behind the scenes, tirelessly working to enhance your experience. His commitment is unmatched, and frankly, I havenâ€™t been able to compensate him for the hours he truly deserves. My vision? To have him dedicate his full energy and passion to Fleeting Notes by year's end. To see that dream come to life, I need to secure his financial future.

Although I've experimented with solutions like introducing an annual pricing plan (which, by the way, did bring some relief), the current income still falls short of getting Gonzalo on board full-time. Right now, he's squeezing us into a tight 10-hour slot every month.

A big leap awaits us if we aim to have him work a full 40-hour week. Which is why I'm rolling up my sleeves, ramping up marketing efforts, and planning to reach out to a larger audience through content marketing.

Moreover, I firmly believe that the bedrock of a successful business is its connection with its customers. So, I've been dedicating a significant chunk of my time connecting, listening, and responding to you, the heart and soul of Fleeting Notes.

### The Future is Bright ðŸŒŸ

Every venture, every startup, and every dream undergoes its fair share of ups and downs. And while there are challenges, there's also an excitement about the future. I genuinely believe in the potential of Fleeting Notes and am keen to see how it evolves with all your support.

Stay connected, keep the feedback flowing, and let's build a brighter future for Fleeting Notes together!
