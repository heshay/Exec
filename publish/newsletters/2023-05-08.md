What I've been up to since I've left my full-time job:

- **Tag autocompletion, Open AI Integration, & better note sharing** Based on feedback from you, I've been working on new features I know you'll love!
- **For my first week unemployed, I wasted 50+ hours** working on a highly requested rich text editor. I've scrapped the project but this doesn't mean I'm not going to add a rich text editor.
- **Personal Update from me:** I've been neglecting marketing which has slowed growth. This week there'll be a bit more focus on content creation. 

# What's new and what's to come
Since I blundered my first week of full-time Fleeting Notes work there isn't much released. But for next newsletter there'll be more :) 

## Released / In the next Release
-  [Tag autocomplete](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/138): Similar to links when pressing `[[`. An essential feature if you are a frequent user of tags.

# For my first week unemployed, I wasted 50+ hours.
During my first week of unemployment, I managed to waste 50+ hours on a project that was ultimately scrapped. But despite the setback, I learned a valuable lesson about problem-solving and feature validation in the process.

## A New Editing Experience: The Project That Never Was

My focus for the week was creating a new editing experience for Fleeting Notes. Users had been requesting it, and I thought it was essential for future features. I estimated that it would take around 10 hours, but after investing more than 50 hours into the project, I threw in the towel.

I was close to finishing, but I realized that the framework I was using for the rich text editor diminished the writing experience. It was time to step back and reassess.

## Learning from My Mistakes: Validate the Solution, Not Just the Problem

What I took away from this experience is the importance of validating both the problem _and_ the solution. I had plenty of user demand for the new editor, but I didn't consider how long it would take to implement or the potential technical debt it could create.

In the future, when working on a big task like this, I'll first validate the solution by creating mini snippets of code to test the feature's feasibilityâ€”kind of like an MVP (minimum viable product), but for a feature.

## Looking Ahead: A Better Framework and a Rich Text Editor

This experience hasn't deterred me from the problem; it's merely made me reconsider my approach. There's a new framework in the works that could solve many of the issues I encountered. My plan is to use this improved framework to create the rich text editor that Fleeting Notes users have been asking for.

In the end, my first week of unemployment taught me a valuable lesson in time management and the importance of validating solutions. It's a lesson that I'll carry with me as I continue to develop Fleeting Notes and, ultimately, achieve my entrepreneurial dreams.


# An Update for My Startup: Embracing Marketing and Setting Goals

April 28th marked my last day of work, and I'm finally free to focus on my passion project, Fleeting Notes! By now, you've probably read about my journey, including my biggest blunder: not working on _any_ marketing at all.

## The Importance of Marketing for Entrepreneurs

As an entrepreneur, it's critical to work on marketing. I used to think that being an entrepreneur was all about building a good product, but I couldn't have been more wrong. Marketing and getting people to use your product are essential aspects of building a successful business.

## New Marketing Strategies and Goals

This week, I'm determined to step up my marketing game and avoid being a "lazy butt." I'm setting a goal to grow Fleeting Notes and, with a little extra push, I hope to reach my next milestone.

My marketing efforts will focus on creating content for YouTube Reels, Instagram Shorts, TikToks, and other platforms. I believe these short, engaging videos will help me reach a wider audience and show off the features and benefits of Fleeting Notes.

## Join Me on This Journey

If you've ever tried any of these marketing strategies before and have advice or insights, I'd love to hear from you! You can also follow my journey on Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook.

While I might have used my lack of marketing as an excuse for not achieving my goals in the past, the next two weeks are going to be different. I'm going all in and aiming to reach the 186th subscriber by May 22nd. It'll be a fantastic birthday present for me and a testament to the power of marketing in the world of entrepreneurship.

Let's do this!
