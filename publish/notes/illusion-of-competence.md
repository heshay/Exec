The Illusion of Competence is a cognitive bias where individuals incorrectly assess their ability to comprehend or recall information. This typically occurs when passive learning strategies, like reading or highlighting, create a misleading sense of familiarity with the material, leading to an overestimation of understanding. In actuality, the depth of understanding may be shallow or incomplete. It's a pitfall in the learning process that emphasizes the need for active learning methods, such as the practice of taking smart notes.
