The Q/E/C method stands for "Question, Evidence, Conclusion" and it's a structured approach to note-taking that encourages active learning. Here's a quick breakdown:

- **Question**: Identify the main question or problem the material you're reading is trying to address.
- **Evidence**: Highlight or jot down the facts, examples, or ideas that support or provide an answer to the question.
- **Conclusion**: Note down the conclusion or summary that the material presents based on the evidence.

This method turns passive reading into an active process. By searching for questions, evidences, and conclusions, you engage with the material on a deeper level, which aids understanding and retention.
