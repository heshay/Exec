title: To create useful links, we need to connect, not group

The focus for creating useful links is on making connections between notes and NOT making groups. Ideas need to be [[notes/atomic things are self-contained|atomic]] and grouping things doesn't create atomic ideas.

When we don't create links atomic links (e.g. `[[school]]`), there will be many connections with very little meaning, adding [[notes/clutter slows us down|clutter]].
