Bi-directional links, also known as backlinks or cross-references, are links that connect two or more pieces of information in both directions. In other words, a bi-directional link allows you to navigate from one piece of information to another and back again.

They can be a powerful tool for building a personal knowledge base and for making connections between related ideas. They can also make it easier to find and access specific pieces of information within a large collection of notes.
